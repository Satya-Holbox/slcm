# 🧠 Central Backend Module Integration Guide

Welcome! This repository contains the central backend for our project. If you're a developer adding a new module, please follow the steps below to ensure proper integration and maintain consistency across the project.

## 🚀 Steps to Add a New Module

If you're developing a new module, follow the steps below to integrate your work into the central backend:

---

### 🔧 1. Add Your Code

- Use your assigned directory (e.g., `dir6/`).
- Inside your directory, paste your `.py` files (e.g., `dir6.py`) with all your module code.

---

### 📝 2. Add a `.ReadMe` File

Inside your module directory, create a `.ReadMe` file containing the following information:

- Overview of the module  
- Endpoints you added  
- Setup/installation steps (if any)  
- Example request/response  
- Dependencies used  

📌 **Reference:** You can check the structure and content of the `face_detection` module as an example.

---

### 🌐 3. Update `app.py`

- Import your module and create an endpoint to expose its functionality via the central Flask app.

#### Example:

```python
from dir6.dir6 import your_function

@app.route('/dir6/your-function', methods=['GET'])
def handle_function():
    return your_function()

```

---

### 🌐 4. Update `requirements.txt`

- Add any dependencies your module requires.

✅ Important: Before adding, check if the dependency is already listed to avoid duplication or version conflicts.

📌 For reference, you can check the structure and content of the face_detection module.
