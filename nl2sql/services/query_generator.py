Tables:
- customers(customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, registration_date): This table stores information about customers, including their contact details and the date they registered.

- orders(order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, total_amount): This table stores details about orders, including the customer who placed the order, the product ordered, and the total amount.
    - `customer_id` refers to the `customers.customer_id` (foreign key).
    - `product_id` refers to the `products.product_id` (foreign key).

- products(product_id, product_name, price, category): This table contains information about the products, including the name, price, and category.
    - `category` refers to `categories.category_id` (foreign key).

- sales(sale_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, sale_date): This table stores the details of sales, including which product was sold, in what quantity, and on what date.
    - `order_id` refers to `orders.order_id` (foreign key).
    - `product_id` refers to `products.product_id` (foreign key).

- order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, total_price, discount): This table stores individual items from each order, including the price per unit, total price, and any discount applied.
    - `order_id` refers to `orders.order_id` (foreign key).
    - `product_id` refers to `products.product_id` (foreign key).
    - The `total_price` column represents the total value of the items in the order before any discount is applied.
    - The `discount` column represents any discount applied to the items.

- categories(category_id, category_name, description): This table contains product categories, with a description for each category.

Relationships:
- `orders.customer_id` refers to `customers.customer_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `orders.product_id` refers to `products.product_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `sales.order_id` refers to `orders.order_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `sales.product_id` refers to `products.product_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `order_items.order_id` refers to `orders.order_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `order_items.product_id` refers to `products.product_id` (foreign key relationship).
- `products.category` refers to `categories.category_id` (foreign key relationship).

Important Notes:
- The `total_price` column exists in the `order_items` table and represents the total cost of the items in the order before any discount.
- The `sales` table contains sales details, and you may need to join it with the `order_items` table to get the full sales price information.
- The `customer_id` column in `orders` is used to link to the `customers` table, and it should not be ambiguous in the queries.
- `products.category` should refer to the `categories.category_id` to identify the correct category for each product.

Please make sure that all references are properly resolved (e.g., `customer_id` from `orders` must be unambiguous, and `category` should refer to `categories.category_id`).
