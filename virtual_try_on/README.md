# Virtual Try-On Backend

This FastAPI backend exposes an API to **try garments on models virtually** using the Fashn API. It allows you to upload a model photo and a garment image, and returns a composite try-on output.

---

## Feature Description

This service enables **AI-powered fashion try-on**. Users can upload base64-encoded images of a person (model) and a clothing item (garment), and the system returns a photorealistic output showing how the garment would look on the model.

Ideal for fashion e-commerce, virtual shopping, and styling apps.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

    ````env
    FASHN_API_URL=https://your-fashn-api-endpoint.com
    FASHN_AUTH_KEY=your_auth_key_here
    ````

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

  - `processing`
  - `completed`
  - `failed`

---

## Usage

1. Send a POST request to `/virtual-tryon/run` with base64 images.

## Notes

- Uses Fashn's third-party AI API under the hood.
- All image inputs must be base64-encoded strings.
- Configure the `.env` with valid Fashn API credentials.
- Easy testing available via Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
